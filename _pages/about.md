About me
====== 
I'm currently completing my dissertation research, which is presently titled, <i>Shrinking Cities: a geographic analysis of population change and reinvestment in the US.</i> I am investigating patterns and dynamics of urban change at multiple spatial scales, and I am specifically curious about the role of public-private development in addressing spatial inequities. The objective of this project is two fold: (1) to explain variation in the kinds of communities facing challenges associated with population loss, and (2) to examine efficacy in revitalization efforts that employ placed-based incentives, which aim to target investment into underdeveloped/disinvested areas. 

My broader research interests cover topics in urban and economic geography, with a specific attention to issues of inequality and unevenness in processes of urbanization and development, and evaluating corresponding strategies of urban and regional policy and planning. I primarily use quantitative methods, and frequently work with US Census products and other national socio-demographic/socio-economic datasets. I have a background in urban studies and spatial analysis, and continue to grow my skillsets in areas of spatial statistics and modeling, geographic information systems, data mining, and machine learning. 

Bio
======
David Karp is a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography, at the University of Buffalo, State University of New York (expected graduation 2022). He completed his undergraduate degree in Urban Studies (2010), and masters degree in Urban Spatial Analytics (2013), both at the University of Pennsylvania. He is a Presidential fellow at UB, working under the advisement of Dr. Sharmistha Bagchi-Sen, where his dissertation research is investigating shrinking cities and urban reinvestment in the US. In addition to course work in economic geography, spatial statistics, and data mining, he has taught an undergraduate lab on Earth, Environment, and Climate for the past four years. Prior to starting his doctorate, he spent five years working with a multi-disciplinary research group at the Perlman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania and the Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University. As project manager and senior data analyst, he worked closely with multiple PIs, to develop a research portfolio on population health and health systems planning for acute care medicine. He assistated with drafting and submitting multiple Federal R01 grants, helped manage two active grants from NIH and HHS, and co-authored numerous peer-reviewed journal articles. Other professional and research experience includes work with the Penn Institute for Urban Research and the Wharton School, as assistant to Dr. Susan Wachter.
